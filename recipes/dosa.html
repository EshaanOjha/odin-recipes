    <p>
        A dosa is a popular South Indian, thin, savory crepe or pancake made from a fermented batter of rice and black lentils, similar in appearance to a crepe but with a distinct, slightly tangy flavor and crispy texture when cooked. Served hot, it's often filled with spiced potatoes (Masala Dosa) or enjoyed plain with accompaniments like sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew) and chutneys (coconut, mint, etc.).
